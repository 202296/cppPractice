# Overview

I've developed a Hangman game software as part of my journey to enhance my skills as a software engineer. The game allows users to guess a hidden word by inputting letters, with limited incorrect guesses before losing. It's a fun project that helps me practice programming concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.

The purpose of creating this software is to deepen my understanding of programming fundamentals, including variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Additionally, it allows me to explore concepts such as file I/O, data structures, and object-oriented programming through the implementation of the game logic.
